[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/quantstamp/qsp-protocol-audit-contract/badge.svg?branch=develop&t=kDg4aW)](https://coveralls.io/github/quantstamp/qsp-protocol-audit-contract)

This repository contains contracts for interfacing with the QSP audit protocol.

- `QuantstampAudit.sol` is the main contract used for interfacing with the protocol. It allows, among other things, the users to request audits and query their state, the node operators to stake funds and bid on audits, and handle refunds. It also governs the assignment of audits.
- `QuantstampAuditData.sol` stores information about the audits.
- `QuantstampAuditMultiRequestData.sol` stores information about audits that should be processed by several audit nodes.
- `QuantstampAuditReportData.sol` stores compressed reports on-chain.
- `QuantstampAuditTokenEscrow.sol` holds tokens staked by audit nodes in an escrow.
- `QuantstampAuditView.sol` provides view functionality for the state of the protocol.

## Access deployed contracts

The addresses of the deployed contracts could be fetched from these locations that persist across deployments. 
Considering the version from `package.json`, the addresses are stored in two locations which are labeled by
major version and full version. The one with major version contains the lasted addresses of the all minor versions.
For example, considering three files `QuantstampAuditData-v-0.1.1-meta.json`, 
`QuantstampAuditData-v-0.1.0-meta.json`, and `QuantstampAuditData-v-0-meta.json`, the last one has the same content
as the first one.

Below is the list of links associated for _V0_. To retrieve the minor versions, replace major version with full 
version in each path. For example, if you want to retrieve address of `QuantstampAudit` for _v0.1.0_, 
change `QuantstampAudit-v-0-meta.json` to `QuantstampAudit-v-0.1.0-meta.json` in the appropriate uri.

## Run locally
### Requirements

* Node.JS v8 with npm

### Steps

1. `npm install`
1. For convenience, install Truffle globally: `npm install -g truffle@0.0.0`, replacing `0.0.0` by the Truffle version from `package.json`
1. Install Ganache (Formerly, `testrpc`), either:
    1. [UI version](http://truffleframework.com/ganache/) of version `1.1.0` or
    1. Console version: `npm install -g ganache-cli@6.1.0` and then (from another terminal tab): `ganache-cli -p 7545`
1. `truffle compile`
1. `npm test`. To also generate a code coverage report, run `npm run test-cov` instead.
1. To ensure correct commit hooks:
    1. `ln -s -f $(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)/pre-commit $(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)/.git/hooks/pre-commit`
    1. `chmod +x $(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)/.git/hooks/pre-commit`


## CI Tests

The file `buildspec-ci.yml` contains the commands to run on each push.
This includes running Truffle tests and collecting coverage report for [Coveralls](https://coveralls.io/github/quantstamp/qsp-protocol-audit-contract).



## Commands

**Note**: These commands are intenteded for the contract owner only. The description is left here as it relates to the code present in this repository. Before running a command, setup the credentials as described in the internal wiki.

1. `npm run command -- -n=dev -a=whitelist --p 0x123456789` whitelists a node defined by a given address
1. `npm run command -- -n=dev -a=whitelist-owner-in-data-contract` whitelists the owner of the QuantstampAuditData contract (required for updating nodes' min audit price)
1. `npm run command -- -n=dev -a=reset-min-price --p 0x123456789` resets the min price of the given node address to max-uint256
1. `npm run command -- -n=dev -a=set-min-price-to-accept-any-request --p 0x123456789` sets the min price of the given whitelisted node to 0 enabling the [cleanup process](https://quantstamp.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/QUAN/pages/95354881/Monitoring+Resources#MonitoringResources-Cleaningupauditrequests)
1. `npm run command -- -n=dev -a=set-max-assigned --p 100` sets "maximum assigned nodes"
1. `npm run command -- -n=dev -a=get-next-audit-request` calls `getNextAuditRequest()` on the contract. May be useful for cleaning up the audit waiting queue.
1. `npm run command -- -n=dev -a=resolve --p 1 false` calls `resolveErrorReport()` on the contract to resolve the incentive of a given requestId. If the second parameter is true, the requester is paid; otherwise, the audit node. 

## Deploy to Ganache

`npm test` automatically deploys the contract to Ganache and runs tests against it. However, there is an option of deploying the contract to Ganache manually (e.g., for purposes of manual testing)

### Running standalone
1. Install and start Ganache as described in the steps above
1. `truffle test --network development`
1. `truffle migrate --network development`

### Running in Docker
1. `docker run -d -p 7545:8545 trufflesuite/ganache-cli:latest`
1. `truffle test --network development`
1. `truffle migrate --network development`

## Calculating Minimum Audit Price

Audit nodes need to be profitable to have incentives to operate. They receive payments in QSP tokens, but need to pay for gas (to cover the cost of Ethereum transactions) to interact with the Audit smart contract.

Currently, when a user submits an audit request, multiple nodes try to get the audit, by calling `getNextAuditRequest()` on `QuantstampAudit.sol`, but only one is selected. In a set of N nodes, statistically, each node is chosen once every N attempts. Consequently, the minimum price of an audit needs to be set in such a way that it offsets the N-1 failed attempts.

 For N nodes, to calculate the minimum price per audit, that offsets any costs and loses, call:
 
 `node gas.js suggest_min_price --nodes=N`

The commands fetches the current gas price from Etherscan for calculations. If you wish to specify your own gas price, use the parameter `--gasPrice=X`, where X is the desired gas price in Wei.

## Hardware wallet

Interacting with the smart contracts, one can use a Trezor hardware wallet for signing transaction. All he needs to do are alter `truffle.js`
and set the provider field of a desired network to an instance of `TrezorWalletProvider`.
This class accepts an address of a web3 provider, such as infura.

### prerequisites
#### Trezor Drivers
If you are using the Trezor for the first time on your machine, please visit [trezor.io/start](https://trezor.io/start/)
for installing your device's drivers.
#### Java Runtime Edition
For accepting a wallet PIN, make sure a recent version of [JRE](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html)
is executable from the command-line. A successful execution of `java -version` shows the validity of this fact.

Without using a  hardware wallet, one alternatively use `HDWalletProvider` for signing transactions. This wallet accepts 
a mnemonic key and a web3 provider address for signing transactions.
